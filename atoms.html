	<h3> What are Atoms? </h3> </p>
	<p> Atoms are the smallest unit of ordinary matter. 
	</p>
	<p> <h3> What makes up an Atom? </h3> </p>
	<p> They are made up of subatomic particles known as protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are known to have a positive charge, neutrons are neutral, and electrons are negative. 
	The positive and negative are arbitrary, whatâ€™s important is that they are opposites and cancel each other out.
	Atoms have a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, they made up the majority of the mass of the atom. The electrons are found in  an electron shell, moving around the nucleus. 
	This makes up the size of the atom, the more electrons farther from the nucleus, the larger the atom.

	<h3> Types of Atoms </h3> </p>
	<p>
	Atoms can be either neutral or have a charge depending on whether or not the number of protons equal the number of electrons an atom has. If it has a charge, the atom is known as an ion. If it has more protons than electrons, it is known as a cation, meaning it has a positive charge. If it has more electrons than protons, then it is known as an anion, meaning it has a negative charge.
