	 <h2> Atoms </h2> 
<p> Atoms are the smallest unit of matter that have properties of an individual element. Every atom has a nucleus, containing protons and neutrons, and a electrons.
Even though an atom is mostly empty space, protons and neutrons make up the main mass of an atom.

	 <h2> Elements </h2>
<p> Elements are pure subastances that have specific properties at specific temperatures. They consist of atoms that all have the same number of protons. The number of protons
in an atom defines the <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/#view=list"> element</a>. The number of protons also defines the elements atomic number, which is useful when looking at a periodic table. </p>
	
	<h2> Periodic Table </h2> 
<p> The <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/#view=table">periodic table</a> is how chemical elements are presented, ordered by their given atomic number and grouped by their reactivity, etc. </p>
