	 <h2> Atoms </h2> 
<p> Atoms are the smallest unit of matter that have properties of an individual element. Every atom has a nucleus, containing protons and neturons, and a electrons.
Even though an atom is mostly empty space, protons and neturons make up the main mass of an atom.

	 <h2> Elements </h2>
<p> Elements are pure subastances that have specific properties at specific temperatures. They consist of atoms that all have the same number of protons. The number of protons
in an atom defines the <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/#view=list"> element</a>. </p>
	
	<h2> Periodic Table </h2> 
<p> The <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/#view=table">periodic table</a> is how chemical elements are presented, ordered by their given atomic number, their number of protons, and grouped by their reactivity, etc. </p>
