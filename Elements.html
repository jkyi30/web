 <h3> What is an Element? </h3> </p> 
<p>  Chemical elements are pure substances that consist of atoms with the same number of protons. The number of protons in an atom make each atom a unique element. So while different elements can have the same number of neutrons or electrons, they cannot have the same number of protons.</p> 
<p> <h3> Different types of the same Element? </h3> </p> 
<p> Elements in nature can be found having different numbers of neutrons and thereby, a different atomic mass, while still being the same element. 
The same element with a different mass is known to be an isotope of the element, which plays a part in finding the average atomic atomic mass. The average atomic mass is calculated by the weighted average of all naturally occuring isotopes of said element.
The number of protons helps define the element by also being used as the atomic number. </p>
</p> <p> 
The average atomic mass (amu) and atomic number are features of the element you can find on the periodic table of elements.
