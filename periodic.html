	<h3> What is the Periodic Table? </h3> </p> 
	<p> The <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/#view=table ">periodic table</a> of elements, pictured above, is they way in which elements are sorted and organized. </
	<p> <h3> What does it consist of? </h3> </p> 
	<p>
	The table consists of seven periods, rows, and eighteen groups, columns, and is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. 
	<p> The elements are also grouped by properties as denoted by the different colors: (going across the groups)  Alkali Metals, Alkaline-Earth Metals, Transition Metals, Other Metals, Other Non-Metals, Halogens, Noble Gases, (the two rows at the bottom) Actinoid Elements and Lanthanoid Elements. </p>
	<p> Elements in the same group have similar properties such as reactivity and typically they all have the same charge, too, when doing problems involving the element. A catchy way to learn the order and names of the element in the form of a <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgVQKCcfwnU"> song</a> by ASAP Science.  </p>
